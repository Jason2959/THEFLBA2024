					This project was created and developed on by Jason Emefele
					and Erwving Bailey for the FBLA introduction to programming
					in 2024. It consists of a GPA Calculator, a Homepage, and a
					Code Viewer

				<button class="accordion">What is GPA?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						GPA is the cumulative score of a person's grades
						throughout their high school years. GPA is calculated by
						class weight. Most classes are on a scale of 4 with an
						<ul> 
						<li>A being 4</li>
						<li>B being a 3</li> 
						<li>C being a 2</li> 
						<li>D being a 1</li>
						<li>F being a 0</li>
						</ul> However, some classes are rated on a
						scale of 4.5 or 5. For every scale 1 point is deducted
						for every letter grade below an A. For example, if a
						person got a B on a 5 point scale, they would get a 4.

				<button class="accordion">How to improve Gpa</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Gpa can be improved even higher than a 4 if schools
						allow it. Students can take honors classes and get Aâ€™s
						to add a 4.5 to the average to their gpa. Students can
						take even more challenging classes called AP classes
						which are graded on a 5 point scale. If that is not
						available it is reccomended to take simpler classes and achieve higher grades
					</p>

				<button class="accordion">What is Gpa used for?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Gpa is used to see where a person stands in their class.
						Many colleges look at gpa to determine if the student
						performed good enough to get into their school. Coaches
						also use gpa to determine if their student athlete is
						doing good enough in their classes to participate.
