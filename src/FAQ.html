					This project was made in mainly Html5 assisted by CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
					<br><br>
					Html5 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" Style="color:#72868c">source</a> - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML uses elements to help the browsers display the content formed by the other codes. 
					<br><br>
					Css <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" Style="color:#72868c">source</a> - Css is short for Cascading Style Sheets. Css is used for presenting documents that were written using html or xml. Css is the main form of code used for web browsers. We used the Css to format our website.
					<br><br>
					PHP <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-php-the-php-programming-language-meaning-explained/#:~:text=PHP%20is%20an%20open-source,Graphical%20User%20Interfaces%20(GUIs)" Style="color:#72868c">source</a>. - The acronym PHP is actually recursive which means it does not follow the typical format. PHP used to stand for Personal Homepage, but today it stands for hypertext preprocessor. PHP is also used for making web browsers just like Css. PHP runs on the browser and runs lines of commands.
					<br><br>
					JavaScript <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/javascript/" Style="color:#72868c">source</a> - JavaScript is also used for making websites and it runs directly on the browser. JavaScript is used to make websites more appealing. Pop ups, drop down menus, videos, and more are all created using Javascript.
